This repository contains several cases that were analyzed to implement the forced safety injection tank. Input decks till case 6 were to model the FSITs and run in the scenario of SBO with different actuation trials that is with different timings of actuation of FLEX, and FSITs. 
Later the parameters were optimized using RAVEN.
The transient input files are shared that contains the modeling details of the FSITs.
The final input and data files are for Case 7.
The steady State input files is not shared as it contains the modeling and data of the specific plant that cannot be shared
